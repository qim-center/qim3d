# Qim3D (Quantitative Imaging in 3D)

The `qim3d` (kɪm θriː diː) library is designed to make it easier to work with 3D imaging data in Python. It offers a range of features, including data loading and manipulation, image processing and filtering, visualization of 3D data, and analysis of imaging results.

You can easily load and process 3D image data from various file formats, apply filters and transformations to the data, visualize the results using interactive plots and 3D rendering, and perform quantitative analysis on the images.

Whether you are working with medical imaging data, materials science data, or any other type of 3D imaging data, `qim3d` provides a convenient and powerful set of tools to help you analyze and understand your data.

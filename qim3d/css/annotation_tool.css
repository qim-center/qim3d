/* When we created the annotation tool, gradio.ImageEditor did not work as it was supposed to. There was an argument height, width which 
applied to the wrapper around it. Argument canvas_size worked only if you did not upload any image. If you did the canvas would resize
itself to the size of the image. This way we set the width. If you only set the parameter 'width' insted of 'min-width', it doesn'ลง work.
Canceling set max-heigth (the important is necessary) will allow the canvas to be as high as needed according to the picture.*/
canvas{
    min-width: 600px;
    max-height: none !important; /* The '!important' has to be here*/
}

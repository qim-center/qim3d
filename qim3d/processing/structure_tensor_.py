    """Wrapper for the 3D structure tensor implementation from the [structure_tensor package](https://github.com/Skielex/structure-tensor/)

    
    The structure tensor algorithm is a method for analyzing the orientation of fiber-like structures in 3D images. 
    The core of the algorithm involves computing a 3-by-3 matrix at each point in a volume, capturing the local orientation. This matrix, known as the structure tensor, is derived from the gradients of the image intensities and integrates neighborhood information using Gaussian kernels. 
    
    The implementation here used allows for fast and efficient computation using GPU-based processing, making it suitable for large datasets. 
    This efficiency is particularly advantageous for high-resolution imaging techniques like X-ray computed microtomography (Î¼CT). 
    
    Args:
        vol (np.ndarray): 3D NumPy array representing the volume.
        sigma (float, optional): A noise scale, structures smaller than sigma will be removed by smoothing.
        rho (float, optional): An integration scale giving the size over the neighborhood in which the orientation is to be analysed.
        full (bool, optional): A flag indicating that all three eigenvalues should be returned. Default is False.
        visualize (bool, optional): Whether to visualize the structure tensor. Default is False.
        **viz_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments for passed to `qim3d.viz.vectors`. Only used if `visualize=True`.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input volume is not 3D.

    Returns:
        val: An array with shape `(3, *vol.shape)` containing the eigenvalues of the structure tensor.
        vec: An array with shape `(3, *vol.shape)` if `full` is `False`, otherwise `(3, 3, *vol.shape)` containing eigenvectors.

    Example:
        ```python
        import qim3d

        vol = qim3d.examples.NT_128x128x128
        val, vec = qim3d.processing.structure_tensor(vol, visualize=True, axis=2)
        ```

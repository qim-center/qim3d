    """Wrapper for the local thickness function from the [local thickness package](https://github.com/vedranaa/local-thickness)

    The "Fast Local Thickness" by Vedrana Andersen Dahl and Anders Bjorholm Dahl from the Technical University of Denmark is a efficient algorithm for computing local thickness in 2D and 3D images.
    Their method significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional algorithms by utilizing iterative dilation with small structuring elements, rather than the large ones typically used.
    This approach allows the local thickness to be determined much faster, making it feasible for high-resolution volumetric data that are common in contemporary 3D microscopy.

    Testing against conventional methods and other Python-based tools like PoreSpy shows that the new algorithm is both accurate and faster, offering significant improvements in processing time for large datasets.


    Args:
        image (np.ndarray): 2D or 3D NumPy array representing the image/volume.
            If binary, it will be passed directly to the local thickness function.
            If grayscale, it will be binarized using Otsu's method.
        scale (float, optional): Downscaling factor, e.g. 0.5 for halving each dim of the image.
            Default is 1.
        mask (np.ndarray, optional): binary mask of the same size of the image defining parts of the
            image to be included in the computation of the local thickness. Default is None.
        visualize (bool, optional): Whether to visualize the local thickness. Default is False.
        **viz_kwargs: Additional keyword arguments passed to `qim3d.viz.local_thickness`. Only used if `visualize=True`.

    Returns:
        local_thickness (np.ndarray): 2D or 3D NumPy array representing the local thickness of the input image/volume.

    Example:
        ```python
        import qim3d

        fly = qim3d.examples.fly_150x256x256 # 3D volume
        lt_fly = qim3d.processing.local_thickness(fly, visualize=True, axis=0)
        ```

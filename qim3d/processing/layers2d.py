    Works on 2D and 3D data.
    Light one function wrapper around slgbuilder https://github.com/Skielex/slgbuilder to do layer segmentation
    Now uses only MaxflowBuilder for solving.

    Args:
        data: 2D or 3D array on which it will be computed
        inverted: if True, it will invert the brightness of the image
        n_layers: How many layers are we looking for (result in a layer and background)
        delta: Smoothness parameter
        min_margin: If we want more layers, we have to have a margin otherwise they are all going to be exactly the same
        max_margin: Maximum margin between layers
        wrap: If True, starting and ending point of the border between layers are at the same level

    Returns:
        segmentations: list of numpy arrays, even if n_layers == 1, each array is only 0s and 1s, 1s segmenting this specific layer

    Raises:
        TypeError: If Data is not np.array, if n_layers is not integer.
        ValueError: If n_layers is less than 1, if delta is negative or zero

    Example:
        Example is only shown on 2D image, but segment_layers can also take 3D structures.
        ```python
        import qim3d

        layers_image = qim3d.io.load('layers3d.tif')[:,:,0]
        layers = qim3d.processing.segment_layers(layers_image, n_layers = 2)
        layer_lines = qim3d.processing.get_lines(layers)

        from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

        plt.imshow(layers_image, cmap='gray')
        plt.axis('off')
        for layer_line in layer_lines:
            plt.plot(layer_line, linewidth = 3)
